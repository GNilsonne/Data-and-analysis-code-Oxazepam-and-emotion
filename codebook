  Reference wave for shock stimulus
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, shock
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, anticipation to self high condition
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, anticipation to self low condition
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, anticipation to other high condition
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, anticipation to other low condition
  Reference wave for null event
Files that have 13 columns have the following data in each column:
  Time (minutes)
